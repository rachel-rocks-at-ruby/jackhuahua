  <p>Years ago, I was playing with FrontPage, trying to learn it. I needed a topic for my test site, so I chose Jackhuahua.com. I was shocked to find that the dog breed actually existed and was popular. I just thought it was a silly summation of my Sparky.</p>

  <p>Now that I'm a web developer, I've created a version of Jackhuahua where you can create your own accounts and galleries. I hope you enjoy it, and if you ever have questions or concerns, you can always email me at <strong>rachel at jackhuahua dot com</strong>.</p>
